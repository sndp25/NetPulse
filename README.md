## 1. Introduction

NetPluse is a Python script designed to quickly identify reachable hosts within a specified IP subnet using ICMP (Ping) scans. This tool is particularly useful for network administrators, security professionals, and enthusiasts seeking to gain insights into live hosts within a given network range without performing resource-intensive port scanning.

---

## 2. Installation

No installation is required for NetPluse. Simply ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

---

## 3. Usage

To use NetPluse, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script. The script can be executed with the following command:

```bash
python NetPluse.py <subnet>
```

Replace `<subnet>` with the subnet you want to scan in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

---

## 4. Command-line Arguments

- `<subnet>`: The subnet to scan in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

---

## 5. Examples

1. Scan a subnet and display reachable hosts:
   ```bash
   python scanner.py 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

---

## 6. Tips and Best Practices

- Ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any network or IP addresses.
- Run the script responsibly and in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
- Larger subnets may take more time to scan. Be patient and let the script complete its scan.
- Regularly update your system's security settings and software to ensure accurate results.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If the script does not execute, ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the correct path to the script in the terminal.
- If you encounter unexpected behavior, check the input format for correctness and refer to any error messages.

---

## 8. Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Always obtain proper authorization before scanning any network or IP addresses.
- Understand and comply with local laws and regulations related to network scanning and security testing.

---

## 9. Conclusion

NetPluse offers a swift and efficient solution for identifying reachable hosts within a subnet. By leveraging ICMP scans, it provides valuable insights into network reachability without the resource overhead of full port scans.
